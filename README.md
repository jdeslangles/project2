#Project 2 - Photo Sharing App

You will need to create a photo sharing application.

* Users will be able to register and create albums and photos.
* Albums and photos will need to be named and described by their owners and they will also be able to tag photos, and make tags searchable.
* Users will be able to view other users albums.
* They will be able to comment on the photos, and either up vote or down vote them.
* The homepage will display the most popular photos.
